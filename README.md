# Mars Rover Project
It is a programming project that solves the problem posed in https://katalyst.codurance.com/mars-rover

This is a basic documentation of rovers functionality. To be able to execute all the functions and make Mars Rovers walk and explore 
we must make sure we have all the required libraries installed:

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once we have the libraries installed we can start. To move the rovers we only have to introduce in the terminal
the next command:

```console
python src/main.py
```
Then introduce the movements the Rovers has to do:

```console
Write the instructions for rovers e.g MMRMMLM:
```
When you introduce the movements, Mars Rovers will perform them and a plot of its path will appear:
